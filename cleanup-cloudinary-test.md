# Cloudinary Test Cleanup

I've removed all code related to Cloudinary testing while preserving the core Cloudinary functionality for product images. Here's what was done:

1. **Removed from server.js**:
   - Removed the Cloudinary test routes
   - Kept the Cloudinary configuration for product image uploads

2. **Emptied test files**:
   - `routes/cloudinary-test.js`
   - `views/cloudinary-test.html`
   - `test-cloudinary.js`

3. **Simplified cloudinary.js**:
   - Removed test functionality
   - Kept the basic structure for API compatibility

The core Cloudinary integration for product image uploads remains intact and functional. This cleanup removes unnecessary test code while ensuring the main functionality continues to work properly.

## Next Steps

If you want to completely remove these files from your repository, you can run:

```bash
git rm backend/routes/cloudinary-test.js
git rm backend/views/cloudinary-test.html
git rm backend/test-cloudinary.js
git commit -m "Remove Cloudinary test files"
git push
```

Otherwise, the emptied files will remain in your repository but won't affect your application's functionality.
